<b>Nuclear Energy: </b>
<b>Fighting for the Sustainable Well-being of Humans and the Environment</b>

As the world faces the challenges of climate change, energy insecurity, and shifting economic powers, the demand for a transition from traditional energy sources like that of fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives is experiencing a greater influx of investment and knowledge as we go further into the battle between the natural environment and our own human interest and attempt to create a long term balance between the two. This environmental reality has driven a common goal for cleaner, more sustainable energy solutions that will enable sustainable living for generations to come. One of the most controversial clean energy services that shows promise for our global collective sustainability goal is nuclear energy. Its violent historical past has greatly influenced the way that it is approached today; however, that does not mean that it is not a viable alternative.
